\subsection{MapReduce programming model and runtime libraries}
\begin{itemize}
\item map, shuffle, reduce stages, automatically run in parallel
\item MapReduce-MPI, map, s, r run sequentially, c++ and mpi
\item Hadoop
\end{itemize}

In a typical MapReduce runtime library such as MapReduce-MPI, the library
implements three major phases: map, shuffle, and reduce, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:overview_mtmr}(a). Map phase reads the initial input and
emits the intermediate $\langle key, value \rangle$ pairs. Shuffle phase communicates
all the $\langle key, value \rangle$ pairs with the same key to the same process
and forms the key and list of values as the input to reduce function. Reduce
phase applies reduce function to all the values associated with the
same key and output final results.

MapReduce-MPI is a runtime library written in C++ and MPI that
enables MapReduce operations on HPC platforms.
\begin{itemize}
\item mrmpi runs map and reduce function in an individual process.
\item map, read input, apply map function, output intermediate 
output to disk files
\item communication, after map is done on all processes, 
mpi alltoallv
\item reduce, after communication is done, apply reduce.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-blocking MPI collectives}
