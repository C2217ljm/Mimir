Mimir is a memory-efficient and scalable MapReduce implementation over MPI for 
supercomputing systems. The inefficient memory use of 
[MapReduce-MPI](http://mapreduce.sandia.gov/) drives the design of this new 
library. The work is summarized in IPDPS 2017 paper:

T. Gao, Y. Guo, B. Zhang, P. Cicotti, Y. Lu, P. Balaji, and M. Taufer.
